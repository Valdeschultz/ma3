    "Think about how we have used LLMs so far: We have given an LLM a single task. It's easy to consider that we could *chain* these tasks together to create a more complex system. For example, we could ask a language model to generate a summary of a text, and then - in a separate step - ask it to classify the sentiment of the summary. This is what we call *chaining* of LLM tasks. In chains, a sequence of actions is hardcoded (in code). In agents, a language model is used as a *reasoning engine* to determine which actions to take and in which order. In other words, an AI agent is a system that uses an LLM to decide the control flow of an application, instead of having it hardcoded. \n",

    "3. Take an action (e.g. generate a summary)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think about the implications of this for a moment. If we can get an LLM to consider a task and then decide for itself how best to solve it, we are approaching a very human-like way of thinking.\n",

This LLM provides an output - not back to the user but to the next nodes, routed via *conditional edges*. In other words, the LLM (our the output of the latest LLM node) will determine which route we will take to answer the query - or carry out the associated task.

For example, Nodes can contain LLM calls (Generate text or make decisions), Tool calls (Interact with external systems), Conditional logic (Determine next steps), Human intervention (Get input from users). Some nodes necessary for the whole workflow like `START` and `END` exist from LangGraph directly. |\n",
